# Welcome to Module 103 of Digital DNA!


If you are wondering when we will focus on acquisition and contracting strategies that support Agile, DevSecOps, etc., get excited - that is the focus of the second half of Digital DNA, which starts now with Module 103: From User Need to Acquisition Award. 

Digital DNA does _not_ provide a universal formula for managing, contracting, building, or running software intensive programs. There are teams that will be successful utilizing alternative approaches than those described and recommended in this course. What we hope to provide is a way to approach problems and strategies that incorporate Agile, DevSecOps, and modern software concepts across your program and team. 

### !callout-info
## Course Mantra
The mantra of the course ***‘it depends’*** will be prevalent moving forward. ***Your context--program, operational environment, team expertise--are all driving factors in your overall approach, it is a continuous process of adapting and learning that will change over time.***

### !callout-warning
## Module 103 Disclaimer
This training unit is not intended to usurp existing laws, regulations, or agency policy. **Module 103** highlights and discusses specific sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and pathways from the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF), providing some ways they can be utilized. We cannot _and do not_ cover every situation. As we have stated throughout the course, there are many ways to implement -- keep in mind, ‘it depends’ is almost an official mantra. Our recommendations:

* **Start Brainstorming**: Use this release (and other documents) to support team brainstorming
* **Allow Divergent Thinking**: Think of several ways to achieve the desired state before selecting an approach. Remember: building flexibility into your strategies is designing for change - which is guaranteed to happen!
* **Explore the Art of the Possible**: No two programs are the same. Copying acquisition and contracting strategies originally tailored for another program will artificially limit solutions.
* **Provide Feedback**: Help us continue to update support for the Acquisition community. This module calls out specific sections of the FAR  building strategies that can be used to execute software acquisition programs, however, this training material should not be read too narrowly. Additionally, this and previous courses are living documents. We urge you to provide feedback, share experiences, and offer additional strategies, tips, policies, or contract language to assure that future iterations of the course are increasingly comprehensive for future students.

### !end-callout

We began this course with a technical focus to ensure we have common language and definitions prior to addressing acquisitions and contracting. Keep in mind, our actions as software acquisition professionals support the obligation and expenditure of millions  of dollars- billions, if we add portfolios or if you support a large Acquisition Category (ACAT) I Level Program.

Acquisitions professionals often talk about $10M or $100M casually, and have become numb to large dollar figures. Even this course is somewhat casual regarding the budgets we execute- however, we want to impress upon our students that while we understand the DoD’s scope is large, remember to start small when implementing. One of the first applications for starting small is both **scope** and **funding**.

In the DoD, the timeline and funding for pilots and pathfinders are an order of magnitude (10-100x) higher than what startups and ideas are given in industry. While we do understand that we often have higher barriers of entry that contribute to higher costs (increased security, lack of enterprise solutions, etc), ***don’t forget to experiment.*** In prioritizing experimentation, we foster innovation.

After experimentation, use your new knowledge and past successes to support scale. Remember, there is no such thing as a perfect contract or strategy. It’s impossible to anticipate everything that changes as programs and technology evolve and mature, nor should you try. The best we can do is ensure we are able to learn and quickly adapt. 

Throughout Module 103 and 104, we hope to provide pertinent examples, and teach practices that will help you to incorporate flexibility. We believe that is our best tool for remaining responsive to changing technology, and the ways in which our adversaries change over time given their own advances in technology.

* title: Prioritization
<!-- * points: [1] (optional, the number of points for scoring as a checkpoint) -->
<!-- * topics: [python, pandas] (optional the topics for analyzing points) -->

##### !question

What are ways that you can prioritize an effort that minimizes risk and allows for learning prior to scale:

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Constrain obligated funds--leave a portion of funding un-obligated intentionally
* Distribute work among multiple contracts
* Limit contract awards to simplified acquisition thresholds
* Phase contract awards over time
* Limit the scope to a portion of full capability

##### !end-options

##### !answer

* Constrain obligated funds--leave a portion of funding un-obligated intentionally
* Distribute work among multiple contracts
* Limit contract awards to simplified acquisition thresholds
* Phase contract awards over time
* Limit the scope to a portion of full capability

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation
All of these are ways you can mitigate risk. We have minimized investment (dollars), dependency (multiple vendors), time to award (simplified acquisition procedures), ability to incorporate learnings (phasing contract awards), and limited technical scope (confirm viability).

## Reminders
* The Pre-Assessment:
    * Must be completed *prior* to starting Phase A **and** 
    * Must be completed prior to **COB Monday, November 8th.** _If you do not complete before you will be deferred to the next offering of 103 From User Need to Contract Award._
* Phasing Content: We will send reminders throughout the course to complete content and to ensure you are progressing. This _recommended_ phasing is beneficial because it: 
    * Allows for you to get maximum interaction with learning guides and feedback on your answers, and
    * Prevents you from having to cram all the content in last minute.
* Course Completion: 
    * **All content** must be completed prior to **COB Wednesday, November 17th.**
    * To continue on to Module 104, you must receive an **80% or greater on the post assessment.** 
    * Don’t forget about the survey this is how we continue to improve the course!
* Office Hours: We will continue to host office hours where you can drop in and speak with the learning guides about the material or ask program specific questions.
    * You will be receiving calendar invites for Office Hours throughout the two-week period when Module 103 is offered. _These are optional._
