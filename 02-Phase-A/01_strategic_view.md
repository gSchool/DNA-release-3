# Strategic View: Implementing a Software-Intensive Acquisition is a Team Effort

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* Understand your potential for impact, both as an individual and with network support
* Apply feedback loops to multiple processes and practices

## The Path to Success: You Are Already On It

In life and in your work, it’s important to pause and reflect - reciting affirmations, checking off a to-do list, even getting a head start are all ways to help with motivation and sustaining your energy to keep going. Hopefully, this course helps keep you motivated from a few standpoints.

First, we would like to extend our congratulations - you’re over halfway through Digital DNA! At this point, you have completed two Releases of Digital DNA, covering the foundations of modern software practices and process--Agile, Lean, Design Thinking, DevSecOps and more. Here is where you got a good head start - you have covered the **foundations** of these concepts - but technology is constantly evolving, and there is always more to learn.

Now we would like to address individual impact or contributions. We recognize that you all have different backgrounds and ranks, and certain lessons will be more applicable to your role and/or day to day responsibilities. But remember, **we can all drive change and impact:**

><span style="float:right;font-family: script; font-size: 1.2em">- The Dalai Lama</span>
>
> <span style="clear:both">&nbsp;</span>

If your checklist includes expanding your network and connections, you are not alone. You already have a team supporting you, including your Program Office. But you also have your functional community, and the network you are meeting through Digital DNA virtual events. Additional opportunities to connect through communities of practice (CoP) like the DoD Acquisition Innovators CoP are also a consideration. We are in an infinite cycle that achieves innovation, excellence, and agility through collaboration:

But as with every institution this large and varied, myths exist about our roles and capabilities. The next section looks at some myths within acquisitions, and provides some mythbusters. 

##Debunking Myths: The Acquisition Operating Model

Let’s start by addressing the elephant in the room: **Starting from the same understanding or assumptions is critical.** This is important, because even if we do not successfully convince you of the next two points, _this is the perspective the lessons are being taught from_. The points below address myths that are commonly held about acquisitions and its role(s).

###1. Acquisition Reform is Not a New Idea

There is room for improvement within all Defense Acquisition System (DAS) processes, which are defined as the following: 

![Management, Requirements, Funding Venn Diagram](__images/02_venn.png)  
<span style="font-size: .8em"> Source: [ ACQNotes: Acquisition Process Overview.](https://acqnotes.com/acqnote/acquisitions/acquisition-process-overview)  </span>

The Center of Military History published a paper in 2011 called [Defense Acquisition Reform, 1960–2009: An Elusive Goal](https://history.army.mil/html/books/051/51-3-1/CMH_Pub_51-3-1.pdf). From the title alone, it is clear that acquisitions reform, much like software development, is in a state of continuous improvement, and that this idea has been around for 60+ years.

Later in this lesson and throughout Release 3, we will provide strategies to establish feedback loops. These strategies structure your processes, acquisition strategy, and contracting approach, while striving to identify the intent, goal or result while validating via data and metrics. 

##2. Improving Current Processes: A Better Starting Point Than Eliminating Everything and Trying To Create All-New
We assume that some of you may not agree with this statement. Thus, we are going to defend the statement in two ways:

<span style="font-family: script; font-size: 1.5em">1. Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.</span>

“...is an idiomatic expression for an avoidable error in which something good is eliminated when trying to get rid of something bad, or in other words, rejecting the favorable along with the unfavorable.”
Source: “Don't Throw the Baby out with the Bathwater.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 9 Jan. 2021.

The point being although as stated in our first myth debunking, we agree there is room for improvement but starting with the current processes and optimizing is less risky. Additionally, we may inadvertently throw out something valuable in the process if we throw everything out.

<span style="font-family: script; font-size: 1.5em">2. Go with a Brownfield approach<span style="font-family: script; font-size: 1.5em">

As we discussed in Release 2, Greenfield and Brownfield approaches both have individual positives, but we recommend a Brownfield approach for a few reasons. It is less risky, allows the ability to navigate dependencies, provides a clear goal, and may even take less time. 

Hopefully we have convinced you that the best starting point is to optimize and tailor current processes to support our goals with Acquisition Reform. This will continue to allow us to keep pace in an ever changing technological and adversarial market because “...today, every domain is contested—air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.”

##Level Setting: The Starting Point For You

We recognize that many of you are at different stages of digital transformation, and are incorporating modern software practices and processes to varying degrees. The programs you support may have already established a software pipeline and environments that enable software delivery as required by your users. Others may be just beginning this journey, deciding on an appropriate acquisition strategy or awarding their first contract.

Similarly, we recognize the skill-sets currently supporting your team vary. Not all of us have access to full stack engineers, Cloud architects, developers, etc. that support your DevSecOps effort.

Throughout Release 3, we provide overarching strategies and some tactical applications. Regardless of whether we are discussing a larger strategy, or a more detailed tactical approach, you will see a consistent theme for defining a feedback loop: 

* **Intent / Goal**
* **Approach / Strategy**
* **Established Inputs (Feedback):**
  * **Who**: Stakeholders/users
  * **What**: Data/Metrics
  * **When**: Cycle Time
  * **How**: Interviews/Surveys
* **Improvements and Learning Incorporated**

Other ways you may have seen this defined is:

We believe applying this approach, regardless of exact implementation, will allow acquisitions professionals to be able to incorporate continuous learning and support improved communications. From acquisition strategies and individual and portfolio contracts, to product development, all can potentially benefit from implementing a greater level of feedback.

## An Application Study: Digital DNA

## Striking a Balance: Tools and Strategies
We want to focus on providing a way to apply this knowledge in a scenario most of you encounter. What tools can we use to support the desired state?

We define the desired state (within the context of a PMO) as: **The ability to effectively make decisions in a timely manner, with a balanced representation of roles (or functions) at each decision point, and supporting data and information transparent/accessible.**

Methods for achieving this can vary. The context of your program--the mission, the operating environment, the users, existing and emerging contracts, or your current team can all vary. But we do believe in focusing first on your current environment. The way you implement new practices should:

1. Be Transparent and Accessible
1. Have A Balance of Perspectives, And Incorporate Multiple Roles
1. Be Timely and Flexible With Its Decisions
1. Feature Continual Learning and Improvement
1. Extend Empathy To All Communities
