Hopefully this disclaimer looks familiar! We included this as part of the Welcome unit of Release 3, but since it's so important to emphasize, we're using it to kick off Phase B of this release.  

### !callout-info
## Disclaimer
This training unit is not intended to usurp existing laws, regulations, or agency policy. **Release 3** highlights and discusses specific sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and pathways from the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF), providing some ways they can be utilized. We cannot (and do not) cover every situation. As we have stated throughout the course, there are many ways to implement -- keep in mind, ‘it depends’ is almost an official mantra. Our recommendations:  

* **Start Brainstorming:** Use this release (and other documents) to support team brainstorming  

* **Allow Divergent Thinking:** Think of several ways to achieve the desired state before selecting an approach. Remember: building flexibility into your strategies is designing for change - which is guaranteed to happen!  

* **Explore the Art of the Possible:** No two programs are the same. Copying acquisition and contracting strategies originally tailored for another program will artificially limit solutions.  

* **Provide Feedback:** Help us continue to update support for the Acquisition community. This module calls out specific sections of the FAR  building strategies that can be used to execute software acquisition programs, however, this training material should not be read too narrowly. Additionally, this and previous courses are living documents. We urge you to provide feedback, share experiences, and offer additional strategies, tips, policies, or contract language to assure that future iterations of the course are increasingly comprehensive for future students.
