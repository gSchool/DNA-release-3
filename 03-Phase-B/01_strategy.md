# Strategies: Acquisition and Contracting 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* Understand the difference between acquisition strategies and contracting strategies.
* Recognize the unique considerations of acquisition and contracting strategies for a modern software development program.

## Introduction

Before we cover any more material, let’s restate an essential Agile and DevSecOps mythbuster we emphasized throughout Modules 101 and 102:

<p style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; text-align: center">AGILE, DEVSECOPS, AND/OR ANY OTHER MODERN SOFTWARE PRACTICE<br>
≠<br>
NO PLANNING</p>

What it means is that planning **does not** have to be a multi-year event. Using planning documents that are more than likely already familiar to you, we will tie in the values, processes, and mindset of Agile and DevSecOps--we want to move forward with a new perspective, looking at activities we already do as acquisitions professionals, bringing the true power of business agility to the mission.

### !end-challenge

As the challenge question suggests, anyone involved with a defense acquisition program has likely heard the term acquisition strategy, and that an approved acquisition strategy is required before a program can begin. However, it can sometimes be conflated with a contracting strategy.

An **acquisition strategy** is **more** than a “check the box” activity. It is a _living document_ laying out the plan the program follows to achieve its objectives--given the information known at the time it is created--and _is intended to evolve_ with a program. 

A **contracting strategy** is a **key component** of the acquisition strategy that enables the program to execute via negotiated contracts. If you missed the challenge question, you are not alone--this is a common misunderstanding within acquisitions. 

### !callout-secondary
## Example
Your _acquisition strategy_ utilizes one or multiple pathways from the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF) to support the development and deployment of a new suite of software products through a Government-led development approach. Your _contracting strategy_ utilizes a modular contracting and thus, you will have multiple contracting strategies where each contract strategy aligns to a discrete acquisition objective, such as: 
* an Other Transaction (OT) for enablement services to help upskill your Government team, 
* a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) to issue multiple orders for software development services, 
* and a different GWAC to issue multiple orders for commercial products. <br><br>

Remember, our recommendation is that you utilize a modular contracting approach, thus there would be _multiple contracting strategies_ aligned to discrete acquisition objectives. **Don’t Forget: this is also the preferred approach for IT as defined in the FAR!**

## Acquisition Strategy Further Defined

An **acquisition strategy** is a comprehensive, integrated plan identifying an acquisition approach that describes required business, technical, and support strategies. The plan does this by managing program risks and opportunities, while meeting program objectives--it communicates the relationship between acquisition phases, work efforts and key program events. Examples of program events include decision points, reviews, contract awards, test activities, production considerations, and operational deployment objectives.<br>

Acquisition strategy specifics are driven by the policy of the selected [Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF) pathway](https://aaf.dau.edu/) delivering a solution, capability, or system. We’ll discuss the AAF pathways and their applicability to software--intensive programs in the next lesson, but the graphic below is a quick preview:

## Acquisition Strategy vs. Acquisition Plan

We didn’t have a challenge question, but you guessed it (hopefully)--an acquisition strategy shouldn’t be confused with an acquisition plan. An **acquisition plan** provides the details of how an acquisition strategy will be implemented.

There is some overlap of content between the two, however. There may also be an opportunity in some cases to combine the two, usually for smaller programs. Key differences between the acquisition strategy and acquisition plan are highlighted in the following table:

|Acquisition Strategy (AS)|Acquisition Plan (AP)|
| :----------- | :----------- |
|Required by [AAF pathway policy](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/policies/) |Required by [Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 7](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7) |
|Discusses strategic plan to achieve program objectives across the entire acquisition program lifecycle |Discusses specifics of technical, business, management, and other significant considerations that will control the acquisition |

Try again, this would be selected for an acquisition strategy which supports the entire program rather than a specific acquisition (capability). 
#### !end-explanation

#### !explanation: It is required to initiate and approve a program.
Try again, this would be selected for an acquisition strategy. **The key word is a program.** Recall an acquisition strategy provides framework and an acquisition plan, as part of an acquisition activity (i.e. contract(s)), _typically_ occur laters.

## Who Is Responsible
So now you know the difference between an acquisition strategy and a contracting strategy. But who’s responsible?

The answer: **everyone on the acquisition team.** No one person delivers - we succeed only with comprehensive functional support from all team members.

That being said, identifying and understanding who has authority to make decisions is very important.


| |Acquisition|Contracting|
|---|---|---|
|Authority|[DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500002p.pdf?ver=2020-01-23-144114-093) assigns the program manager responsibilities to: plan acquisition programs, prepare programs for key decisions, execute approved acquisition and product support strategies, and employ a thoughtful, innovative, and disciplined approach to program management in accordance with DoD Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, based on the authority in Sections 113 and 133 of Title 10, U.S. Code (U.S.C.).<br><br>DoDI 5000.02 establishes the AAF pathways, each with their own policy and program manager  responsibilities for managing acquisition programs.<br><br>The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) or Decision Authority (DA), based on the AAF pathway, is the program decision authority and can tailor oversight and decision levels based on the characteristics of the capability being acquired. For certain types/values of programs, decision authority cannot be delegated.|The authority for a contracting officer is based in U.S. Code (U.S.C.). 41 U.S.C. 1702(b)(3)(G) requires agency heads to establish & maintain a procurement career program, including the selection, appointment, and termination of appointment of contracting officers. This authority flows through each service through contracting leadership positions.<br><br>The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides details as to the qualifications required to hold a warrant.<br><br>Above certain dollar values, Contracting Officers have to complete reviews and obtain approvals before negotiating or entering into contracts|


While everyone on the acquisition team is responsible, it’s helpful to understand where the authority for acquisition and contracting comes from to inform responsibility and leadership roles for the tactical level team.

## Why is the Acquisition Strategy Important?

When in doubt, ‘insert Dilbert comic.’

![Dilbert Strategy](__images/12_dilbert.png)
Source: [Dilbert by Scott Adams](https://dilbert.com/strip/2007-06-10)

Jokes aside, plans don’t have to stay stagnant - we can adjust and revisit our approaches as we learn. Remember our emphasis on Build-Measure-Learn? Bring that energy to all aspects of your acquisition.

Just as in our personal lives, in the government, we plan so that we reduce the risk of buying the wrong solution. We want to ensure we are buying the solution our users need at a price we can afford, and serving the outcome they outlined in the requirements.  As you may know from your on-the-job experience, acquisition planning and the strategy will differ somewhat depending on a few factors:
* You may inherit a previously developed contract that requires adjustment, so you will need to build a strategy for making those adjustments.
* You may be involved in developing a new strategy for a new procurement.

**Examples:**
* **Existing Programs**: Adapting an existing acquisition strategy (i.e., transition from a traditional waterfall development strategy to a strategy better suited for software development).
  * An acquisition strategy more than likely will not be updated daily, but probably good to review quarterly or bi-annually and adjust as needed. Also, it may help in leadership buy-in, showing that you plan to update the plan at regular cadences.
* **New Programs**: Reach out to other software intensive programs and see what you can learn from them.   
  * Don't forget you can utilize the Digital DNA network. Incorporate their knowledge as part of developing a new acquisition strategy for a new program.

Key considerations of an acquisition strategy for a software-intensive program include, but are not limited to:
* Train your entire acquisition team for a shared understanding of how and why things will be done differently to support a software development effort
* Start small with number of products, funding invested, and contract ceiling
  * Use a flexible and modular contract strategy enabling software development practices
* Risk-based business and technical management approach for addressing  iterative software delivery balanced with security, intelligence threats, quality, etc.
* Create a roadmap and cadence for software deliveries to operations
* Tailoring of acquisition processes -- remember, one of the goals of the  Adaptive Acquisition Framework  is to support flexible solutions and increase innovation
* Investigate and utilize (as applicable)  existing enterprise services, infrastructure, and resources to include software development tools and government software developers/coders.
* Remove over the fence activities
  * **Example**: shift test left by collaborating early and often  with the test and evaluation community to develop test strategies enabling continuous test.
* Architecture strategies
* Cybersecurity strategies in accordance with applicable cybersecurity policies and issuances
* Intellectual property, training, and product support strategies
* Statutory and regulatory compliance strategy

##### !options

* The program should identify likely commercial or government-provided technical solutions for cloud usage, networking, and establishing environments for DevSecOps or justify why existing enterprise services will not meet the needs.
* Based on technical constraints, prior experience, and other considerations, the program should state whether it has already selected an Agile development framework (e.g., SAFe, Scrum, XP).
* The program should describe what gaps exist, in terms of bringing sufficient expertise in modern software practices into the team.
* Based on the technical vision, the program should describe the approach it will take to software design, highlighting any known constraints and identifying how the program will deal with emergent design issues as the system evolves across iterations.

##### !end-answer

#### !explanation-correct: 
Let's explain the answers above:
* Remember utilizing enterprise services (commercially available or Government managed) allows your team to focus on mission-unique applications. Again, there are reasons this is not feasible for your mission requirement but should be evaluated and documented what conditions would allow you to leverage an enterprise service. 
* When the Government has established teams with a selected Agile development framework articulating both in your acquisition strategy and future contracts will help your organic team and vendors better understand how best to work with you. _Remember, the Government does not have to select or prescribe an Agile development framework._
* Start with your team expertise, identifying the need and quickly providing training opportunities for the entire team is a critical enabler.
* Well-defined processes help teams accelerate, specifically identifying when decisions need to be elevated or can be delegated.

## Contracting Strategy

A **contracting strategy** is part of an overarching acquisition strategy. The contracting strategy discusses the contract(s) put in place to achieve program objectives set out in an acquisition strategy.   

**Examples:**
* A commercial item contract under FAR Part 12
* A task order under an existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract
* An Other Transaction (OT) agreement.
* Contracting strategies also include elements such as contract type selection (i.e., firm-fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, time & materials), product or service contract, competition (i.e., full and open, sole source), and source selection, to name a few.


**Contracting strategies** enable execution of the acquisition strategy. Contracting strategies (FAR-based and non-FAR based) are presented in the [Contracting Cone](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/contracting-cone/).

![Contracting Cone](__images/13_contracting.png)<br>
**Contracting Cone**

Recall that an acquisition strategy for a software program calls for a contracting strategy that enables software development teams to rapidly design, develop, test, integrate, deploy, and support software capabilities.

The [software development scenario](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/contracting-cone/scenarios/software-development/) included in the Contracting Cone highlights specific contracting strategies well-suited for software development. These contracting strategies can be used with any of the AAF pathways. These strategies can also be used in combination as part of a modular contracting strategy for acquiring software-intensive solutions. Modular contracting will be discussed in depth in a future lesson.

![Contracting Scenarios](__images/14_scenarios.png)<br>
[Contracting Cone - Software Development Scenario](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/contracting-cone/scenarios/software-development/)

This is just the start - there is much more to come on the topic of contracting. For now, these basic concepts should be a framework for you to start thinking about how your current strategies and contracts can be reworked in the future to better flow with software development and its unique needs. 

### !callout-success

## Takeaway:

Although acquisition strategies and contracting strategies are **separate**, they are **complementary**.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS Strategies: Acquisition and Contracting 
* **Know the difference between an acquisition strategy and a contracting strategy.**
   * An **acquisition strategy** addresses the _program lifecycle._ It is required by [DoDi 5000.02 Operation of the Adaptive Acquisition Framework,](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500002p.pdf?ver=2020-01-23-144114-093) and as referenced in the [FAR Part 34.](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-34) **It provides the strategic plan.** 
   * A **contracting strategy** and _individual acquisition plan_ addresses **how to achieve** an acquisition strategy with contracts. We recommend utilizing a modular contracting approach to reduce dependencies and allow flexibility to respond to emerging technology, new businesses, and talent. Don’t forget about your available options: for more details, see the [Contracting Cone.](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/contracting-cone/)
* **Authority doesn’t imply sole responsibility.** Remember - it takes a team, and bringing different functions and roles together to support both acquisition and contracting strategies will improve the end result.
