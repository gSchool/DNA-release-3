# The Pathways: The Adaptive Acquisition Framework

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* Understand which AAF pathways are the best candidates for software development.
* Describe the different pathways’ ability to support software-intensive programs.

## Introduction

So, which AAF pathways can or should we use when contracting for software development? This should come as no surprise to you by now, but our answer is ‘**it depends**’.

This module addresses each pathway and how we might leverage them. However, do not let that limit or prevent you from adapting in new and innovative ways! These pathways are subject to change, and there may be opportunities to improve upon what is already available.  

Similar to previous modules, we will be providing summaries and/or a portion of the information available through other resources and training. It is important that after you complete this module, you continue to do your own research. We will provide links for you to further your understanding at the end of the module - feel free to ask for more. 

But first, we keep our promises:

## The Pathways And Their Uses
So you’ve been researching all the new pathways, and are excited to use one in your program. You’re interested in improving a current acquisition strategy, or planning a new capability and need to establish an acquisition strategy for the first time. No matter which situation you find yourself in, the goals remain the same - delivering valuable capability at the speed of relevance.

The pathways available to you will be explored in the following order:

* Major Capability Acquisition
* Urgent Capability Acquisition
* Business System Acquisition
* Acquisition of Services
* Middle Tier of Acquisition
* Software Acquisition

The arrangement of these pathways is intentional. We start with what will probably be the most familiar pathways because they’re the most established, then move toward newly available pathways (Middle Tier of Acquisition and Software Acquisition). We then examine combining pathways, often including the Software Acquisition pathway. How to implement combined pathways has been a common question within the context of our roles as educators and acquisition professionals, so we find it pertinent to address here. However, do not limit yourself to the examples in this discussion - there are always more options!

## Major Capability Acquisition Pathway

The [Major Capability Acquisition (MCA) pathway](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mca/) is for programs intending to acquire and modernize uniquely military programs providing enduring capability. Acquisitions like these typically follow a structured “analyze > design > develop > integrate > test > evaluate > produce > support” approach. 

![Major Capability Acquisition](__images/2b2_mca.jpg)

This pathway is designed to support major defense acquisition programs and systems, as well as other complex acquisitions. Acquisition and product support processes, reviews, and documentation are tailored based on program size, complexity, risk, urgency, and other factors. 

### Pathway Highlights:

* The [Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/CJCSI%205123.01H.pdf?ver=2018-10-26-163922-137) requirements process is jointly applicable as a potential combination of the two.
* MCA programs are designated by an Acquisition Category ([ACAT](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mca/acat/)), which identifies the program’s:
  * Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), 
  * Required processes, and 
  * Documents.
* Statutory and Regulatory requirements are defined in the [Milestone Document Identification (MDID)](https://www.dau.edu/mdid/Pages/Default.aspx).
  * Statutory requirements will not be waived unless permitted by the relevant statute
  * PMs will “tailor-in” the regulatory information that will be used to describe their program at the [MDD](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mca/mdd/) or program inception.
* Successfully demonstrated technologies in an operational environment via the [Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) Rapid Prototyping](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mta/prototyping/) or other prototyping authorities may be transitioned to major capability acquisition programs.

### !callout-info
## Key Takeaway
Remember, you do **not** have to use **only one pathway**. 
### !end-callout



## Urgent Capability Acquisition

### !callout-warning

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

You _cannot choose_ to be a UCA program. A Quick Reaction Capability need **is required** to use this pathway, such as a validated:
* Urgent Operational Need (UON), 
* Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) or 
* Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON).

### !end-callout

![Urgent Capability Acquisition](__images/2b3_uca.png)

The [Urgency Capability Acquisition (UCA) pathway](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/uca/) is intended to field capabilities fulfilling urgent existing and/or emerging operational needs and/or quick reactions **in less than 2 years.**

### Pathway Highlights:

* Requirements processes like the Accelerated Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) apply.
* Features an aggressively streamlined acquisition processes, and documents must be tailored to support capability development and _must deliver 2 years or less._
* Regulatory requirements are tailored or waived as appropriate. Statutory and Regulatory requirements are defined in the [Milestone Document Identification (MDID)](https://www.dau.edu/mdid/Pages/Default.aspx).
* The pathway goal is to plan for capability in a few weeks, with development and production measured in months. Useful capability is quickly delivered to the warfighter.

While you can not choose this pathway, we didn’t want to omit any pathways from here as  UON, JEON or JUON designations are constantly being reviewed which means a program requirement could be handed to your team and you will need to know how to shape your strategy to fit this pathway. 

## Defense Business Systems Pathway

![Defense Business Systems Pathway](__images/2b4_dbs.png)

The [Defense Business Systems (DBS) pathway](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/dbs/) is **applicable for all defense business capabilities and their supporting business systems**, including “as-a-service” solutions like:

* Financial
* Contracting
* Logistics
* Planning & Budgeting
* Installations Management
* Human Resources Management, and
* Training & Readiness Systems.

This pathway may also be used to acquire non-developmental, software intensive programs that aren’t business systems.

### Pathway Highlights:
* JCIDS and MDAP program designations are not applicable.
* [Business System Categories (BCATs)](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/dbs/dbs-bcat/) are defined in the DBS policy ([DoDI 5000.75](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500075p.PDF?ver=2020-01-24-132012-177)).
* [Statutory requirements](https://aaf.dau.edu/overview/) are clearly defined in DBS policy. Conversely, regulatory requirements should be tailored to fit the program need.
* Clinger Cohen Act (CCA) compliance is accomplished using an iterative process.
* The [Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC)](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/dbs/) is intended to be **cyclical** and **flexible**, rapidly achieving intended business outcome(s) based on validated capability need(s).
* BCAC Authority to Proceed (ATP) decision points may be tailored as necessary to successfully deliver business capabilities.
* BCAC implements a unique business systems governance and management structure:
  * Assigns responsibilities to the functional and acquisition communities;
  * Provides direction for the identification of business needs and for the development of capability requirements and their supporting IT;
  * Emphasizes continuous process improvement as part of ongoing business capability support.

Correct! While the intent of the DBS pathway is to explore COTS and other non-developmental software solutions vs. custom software development. However, per [DoDI 5000.87](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500087p.PDF?ver=virAfQj4v_LgN1JxpB_dpA%3d%3d) - Operation Of The Software Acquisition Pathway, programs meeting the definition of a covered Defense Business System ([10 U.S.C. 2222](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:10%20section:2222%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section2222)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) or [40 U.S.C 11103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/11103)) _may elect_ to incorporate the Software pathway for **custom-developed software.**

## Acquisition of Services Pathway

![Acquisition of Services](__images/2b7_as.png)

We have talked a lot about software-as-a-service models. You may be thinking, “This is the pathway for my program.” Well that may be true - but it also may not be.

### !callout-danger

## Remember:

Contracting and acquisition strategies are not the same thing.

### !end-callout

For many programs, the Acquisition of Services Pathway is not viable.

Why? Because the acquisition decision authority for Service Categories (S-CATs) can’t serve as the Milestone Decision Authority or Decision Authority for a defense acquisition program. 

Furthermore, the Acquisition of Services Pathway Policy ([DoDi 5000.74](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500074p.pdf?ver=2020-01-10-083053-313)) is **not applicable**, stating in section 1.1(b)(8):

>“[This issuance does not apply to] Services that are managed and reviewed as part of major and non-major defense acquisition programs and major and non-major information technology (IT) acquisition programs, services that meet the Major Automated Information Systems thresholds (to include software as a service), or non-major programs whose primary purpose is to provide capabilities, goods, or systems in accordance with DoDI 5000.02. However, it may apply to services in the operations and support phase of these programs at the discretion of the milestone decision authority.”

Let’s clarify here. Some of the areas service requirements are found include:
* Maintenance, overhaul, repair, servicing, rehabilitation, salvage, modernization, or modification of supplies, systems, or equipment
* Routine recurring maintenance of real property
* Housekeeping and base services
* Advisory and assistance services (A&AS)
* Operation of government-owned equipment, facilities, and systems
* Communication services
* Architect-engineering (see FAR part 36.6)
* Transportation and related services (see FAR part 47)
* Research and development (see FAR part 35)

### !end-challenge

## Middle Tier of Acquisition Pathway

The [Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) pathway](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mta/) fills a gap in the DAS for capabilities having reached a certain level of maturity, allowing them to be rapidly prototyped or fielded within an acquisition program **within 5 years of program start**. 

![Middle Tier of Acquisition](__images/2b8_mta.jpg)

The MTA pathway may be used to accelerate capability maturation before transitioning to another acquisition pathway or may be used to minimally develop a capability before rapidly fielding.

### Pathway Highlights:

* MTA programs are not subject to the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements process.
* PMs may seek appropriate alternatives to any regulatory requirements increasing burden without adding value to their programs.
* PMs will comply with statutory requirements, unless waived in accordance with relevant provisions.
* Two options within MTA:
  * The [rapid prototyping](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mta/prototyping/) path provides for the use of **innovative technologies** to rapidly develop fieldable prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities and meet emerging military needs.
    * **Objective**: field a prototype meeting defined requirements that can be demonstrated in an operational environment and provide for residual operational capability within 5 years of the MTA program start date.
  * The [rapid fielding](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mta/fielding/) path provides for the use of **proven technologies** to field production quantities of new or upgraded systems with minimal development required.
    * **Objective**: begin production within 6 months and complete fielding within 5 years of the MTA program start date.

### !callout-info

## Note:

Middle Tier is not an acquisition strategy that can be utilized for the lifetime of the program. After _5 years,_ you **must** transfer to another pathway!

### !end-callout

**Software Applicability**: Middle Tier rapid prototyping/rapid fielding may provide an opportunity to demonstrate new software capability in an operational environment, especially if you need more than a year to deliver.  

### !callout-info

## Note:

The Software Pathway does require demonstrated capability **within a 1 year** of funds being obligated. You will learn more about this below.

### !end-callout


If you intend to transition to the Software Acquisition Pathway after MTA, we highly recommend incorporating iterative software development components of the Software Acquisition Pathway.

Tips and more for transitioning can be found on the AAF website. Take some time and click through - there is a lot of information available: [Vignettes to Use Multiple Pathways or Transition Across Acquisition Pathways](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/selecting-a-pathway/)

## Software Acquisition Pathway

![Software Acquisition Pathway](__images/2b10_swap.jpg)

The newest addition to AAF, the [Software Acquisition Pathway](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/software/) is intended to facilitate rapid and iterative delivery of software capability to the user. Examples of these are software-intensive systems and/or software-intensive components or subsystems. The software acquisition pathway is for the timely acquisition of **custom software capabilities** developed for the DoD.

### Pathway Highlights:

* **Not subject** to the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) - _unless the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS), Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment (OUSD A&S), and Service Acquisition Executives (SAEs) agree on a new process specific to software._
* Programs **will not** be treated as Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs).
* No formal milestones. Instead, two phases:
  * [Planning](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/software/planning-phase/) and [Execution](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/software/execution-phase/).
* Delegated decision authorities.
* Programs will **demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of capabilities for operational use not later than 1 year after the date on which funds are first obligated** to develop the new software capability.
  * _Note:_ If your program **cannot** deliver within one (1) year consider using another pathway initially that aligns to the software pathway and transition at a future date
* Similar to the [Defense Innovation Board: Software is Never Done (SWAP Study)](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/30/2002124828/-1/-1/0/SOFTWAREISNEVERDONE_REFACTORINGTHEACQUISITIONCODEFORCOMPETITIVEADVANTAGE_FINAL.SWAP.REPORT.PDF). The Software Acquisition Pathway recognizes that there are two paths for software development:
