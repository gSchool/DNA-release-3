##### !question

Modular contracting is an appropriate strategy for software intensive programs because:

##### !end-question

##### !options
* It decreases risk by decreasing dependency of success on a single vendor (or single vendor and subcontractors) 
* It allows the program to be most responsive to change
* Since all required expertise is not available in any one company, this is the _only_ way to get all required services
* Supports ability to optimize contracting processes, the more you award the more opportunities to learn and improve
* The contracting files for multiple awards are copies and reduces the time required to administer multiple contracts.

##### !question
Select the reasons why you would **advise against** using Cost Reimbursable (CPFF/CPIF) contracts for contractor- or Government-led software development.
##### !end-question

##### !options
* Many services associated with software development are commercially available, i.e. commercial items, which cannot be procured using Cost Reimbursable contracts
* CPFF-term requires specified level of effort for a period of time which can prevent the ability for the Government to re-prioritize backlog
* Cost Reimbursable contracts are preferred for software development
* There are better suited contract types for software development

##### !question

When contracting to enable software development, why is it recommended that cost/price not be the most important evaluation factor? 

##### !end-question

##### !options

* Software programs are expensive and the Government needs to accept that fact 
* In either a Government-led or contractor-led model, you are often acquiring capacity. You can reduce capacity (either hours or delivered iterations) to receive a better quality deliverable
* The Government is getting better at cost estimating and since most proposals will be within a small cost/price range, cost/price does not need to be an important factor. 
* The Government can request more funding if it runs out of money, so cost/price is not an important factor.
